# PROJECT_QUAKE
Earthquake Motion Sensor, SMS Sender

Rough Code, not expected to work right away!

Materials Needed:
Full Materials List
1. Microcontroller:
Arduino UNO (or any compatible Arduino board)

3. Motion Sensor:
MPU6050 (3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope)

5. Communication Module:
GSM Module (e.g., SIM800L or SIM900)
Alternatively, you can use a Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32) if you prefer sending notifications over the internet instead of SMS.

6. Power Supply:
Power Supply for GSM Module (if using SIM800L, it may require a separate power source, typically 3.7V to 4.2V)
USB Cable for powering the Arduino

7. Connecting Wires:
Jumper Wires (male-to-male and/or female-to-male as needed)

8. Breadboard:
Breadboard (optional, for easier connections)

9. SIM Card:
SIM Card with SMS capabilities (for GSM module)

10. Resistors:
Voltage Divider Resistors (if needed for level shifting, depending on your GSM module and Arduino logic levels)

11. Optional Components:
LEDs (for visual indication of status)
Buzzer (for audible alerts)
Push Button (for manual testing or reset)
Enclosure (to house the components)
